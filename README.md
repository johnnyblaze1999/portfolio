# My portfolio was created using React, Vite, Windtailcss, and Jotform

## Getting Started with Node.js
If you don't have Node.js and npm installed. Go and `download` it at [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).

You can check the version of your Node.js and npm using the below commands:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
## Creating Files
`Run` the below command under the terminal. I personally use the one available within VSCode
```
npm create vite@latest
```
`Enter` your project's name

`Select` React as your framework

`Select` Javascript

Move to your project directory and install all of the required dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Run your own server using:
```
npm run dev
```
